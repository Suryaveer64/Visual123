    <p>Project on console</p>
    <p>1. I learned about variables and knew that after every variable we have to write " console.log(name_of_the_variable)" and each sentence ends with a semicolon</p>
    <p>I installed visual stuoio from the link I got in the class.</p>
    <p>According to me Visual studio is ahead of brackets due to maybe its variety of programs that can be installed and its features but still brackets is my best.</p>
<script>
    console.log("Hi I am console screen");
    var first_name = "Ranbir ";
    console.log(first_name);
    var last_name = "Kapoor";
    console.log(last_name);
    var a = 10 ;
    console.log(a);
    var b = 5 ;
    console.log(b);   
    var add = a + b;
    console.log(add);
</script>
